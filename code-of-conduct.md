### How do we plan to collaborate?

  We have planned to collaborate through in-person and online meetings usually before the lectures and meetings at the beginning of each sprint. In these meetings at the beginning of each week, we discuss the progress so far and we divide the remaining issues/tasks accordingly. We create milestones and issues on Gitlab to be able to trace individual contributions. The milestones consist of related features that make general sense together and make up a portion of the system as a whole. We have decided to follow the scrum methods for this project, therefore we are going to have weekly scrum meetings in which we distribute the tasks between the group members and talk about the problems we have encountered during that sprint so that team members could help each other. 

### How do we ensure that everyone in our group stays informed about the individual contributions?

  By following the Git principles, each developer gets assigned to an issue visible by the other developers in the team. Moreover, scrum meetings at the beginning of each sprint and the ones requested during each sprint, ensure a good data transfer among team members.

### How do we ensure knowledge transfer among our team members?

  Code documentation, regular group work, and group communication ensure a good transfer of knowledge among team members.

### What is our usual communication plan?

  We usually communicate in-person during the week and also occasionally online meetings via Discord.

### How will we solve conflicts? 

  Since we have decided to have a scrum master, in case there are any conflicts, first we discuss it and do what the majority of the group says but in case there is a tie, the scrum master (Emrik Dunvald) will decide.

### What are our ideas/measures to prevent conflicts from occurring in first place?
  In order to prevent conflicts from occurring in the first place we have decided to discuss major decisions in situations where everyone is present i.e. during physical or online general meeting. During this time we will ensure that everyone has sufficient space to share their opinions and present any counter-arguments.
